splay_module
============
A joomla module that showcases articles that are currently trending. 
Articles are considered trending when they surpass a certain amount of hits in a given time.
The administrator can set the amount of hits,  the given time,  the number of menu items and horizontal or vertical menu layout.

The trending articles are determined by a MySql scheduled event and are managed under a Splay tree in order to optimize the database operations.

This module was created by I.Smirnios for his diploma in Computers Engineering & Informatics department of University of Patras in cooperation with Graphics, Multimedia & GIS Laboratory.
